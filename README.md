# Tyne

> _“Shape your data. Trust your types.”_

**Tyne** is a minimalist, type-safe schema system for defining data shapes, inferring TypeScript types, validating runtime data, and generating `.d.ts` files. Built for speed, clarity, and type fidelity.

> **Tyne** is a fast and lightweight schema definition library that unifies four core capabilities:
>
> 1. **Shape**: Define the structure of your data declaratively with intuitive syntax.
> 2. **Infer**: Automatically infer precise TypeScript types from your schemas.
> 3. **Validate**: Parse and validate runtime data against the declared structure.
> 4. **Declare**: Generate static `.d.ts` files so your schemas can power external tools and packages.
>
> Whether you're building libraries, APIs, or tools that rely on strong typing, **Tyne** helps you keep your data consistent across dev and runtime — without unnecessary weight.
